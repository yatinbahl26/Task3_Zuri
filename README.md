# Image Gallery Web Application

## About

The Image Gallery Web Application is a web-based platform for discovering information about images. It allows users to search for images and has drag & drop functionality.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
https://github.com/jagmeetkaur03/Task3_Zuri.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
"autoprefixer": "10.4.15",
"firebase": "^10.4.0",
"next": "13.4.19",
"next-auth": "^4.23.1",

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
